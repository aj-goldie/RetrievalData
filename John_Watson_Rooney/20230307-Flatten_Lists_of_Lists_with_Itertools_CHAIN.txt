 Let's imagine we've ended up with a list of lists that we actually need to flatten out. Well, the first thing you might think to do is to use a for loop. So let's do for J in L-O-L and then for I in J and we can then print out our I. Like so. I mean, you could of course add these two a list as we go. The next thing you might think about doing is if you wanted to create a list, well, we could use list comprehension. We'll do I for J in L-O-L for I in J. This is going to create a new list for us, which we can print out. There we go. So now we've successfully flattened this list, but of course there is a better way. We're going to do from it at all's. We're going to import in chain chain is a specifically designed built in function to Python, which does exactly this. Let's create a new variable. I'm going to make it into a list. I'm going to do chain unpack my list of lists into this and then we're going to print out chained. And there we have it. We have our flattened list all nice and neatly using itatels chain.
