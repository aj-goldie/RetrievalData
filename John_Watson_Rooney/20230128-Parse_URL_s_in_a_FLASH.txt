 Here's a long URL. If we wanted to extract some of the query parameters from it, we might want to start thinking about using splits, but don't. Import past from URL lib and give it the URL. This will handle it for us and return each part of it back in a named tuple. Here's the query string, but wait, we need the individual parts. So we can call past qs on the query and it returns it as a dictionary for us. You could also use an external library. Here we are using y'all. It simplifies it even more, but the end result is basically the same.
