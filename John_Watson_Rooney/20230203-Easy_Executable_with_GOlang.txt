 This is a Workscraper over in Go using Kali. It's super easy to write. It's super fast. It scrapes this whole site in about two and a half seconds. But the best thing is we can do Go, Build, Scraper.go. And now we have a full executable file. There it is, Scraper, that we can run on our system. It works with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Super handy. This is one of the best things about Go.
